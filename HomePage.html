        <h2>Welcome to Sh. L.N. Hindu College, Rohtak </h2>
  <p> 
Sh. L.N. Hindu College previously known as Hindu College was founded in 1971 by the Hindu Education Society, Rohtak, for providing value-based education to the growing number of students. To accommodate more and more Students, the College Management purchased 13 acres of land on Bhiwani Road, Rohtak, on which the foundation stone of the new building was laid by 1008 Swami Gurucharan Dass Ji Maharaj in 1974. Subsequently, the heirs of Shri Lal Nath donated 250 Acres of agricultural land to the society. Hence, the college was renamed as Sh. L. N. Hindu College. The college has now carved out its special place on the educational Map of Haryana. It enjoys the reputation of being the premier Institution imparting the quality education in Arts, Commerce, Science, Management, and Information Technology. Our college is committed to the noble task of developing an all-round personality of the students. We have an experienced and well-qualified team of dedicated members of the staff. We are proud of the fact that many of our lecturers and students have been selected in IAS, HCS, and in reputed companies of India and abroad. No doubt, our college has always enjoyed the reputation of having created academically meritorious students. It has been our constant endeavor to groom the personality of the students by giving them exposure in the fields of culture, sports, and other extracurricular activities. Our students always bring laurels to the institution by grabbing the highest academic positions at the university level. Every year, more than 100 students from each stream secure top positions in university examinations. As a token of recognition of the high-quality performance in all fields of education, our college was accredited with B (CGPA 2.74) grade by NAAC in the year 2016. Fortunately, the College Management is always more than ready to provide the funds and other necessary support for the fulfillment of the institutionâ€™s mission. Several quality enhancement activities like Extension lecture, Seminar, Workshops, and Quiz, etc are organized by institutions regularly. Recently our YRC unit was felicitated with the award of excellence for organizing Youth Red Cross activities by the University. Moreover, our students participate regularly in State and National level competitions and make the college proud.
